The Solar System facilitates uploading files and sharing files over the nostr network, as well as
leveraging user identity to build extra features into the network using a simple API.

By default, SOLAR provides invitation, registration, and upload endpoints.

#### Running
Solar is a Python project with no dependencies. It can be run with `python app.py` or by using
a WSGI-compatible server such as Gunicorn.
